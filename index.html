    <div class="project">
      <h3>Modbus Export Processor</h3>
      <p><em>Private repository — available on request</em></p>
      <p>
        A Python-based data processing tool that reads Modbus register definitions from structured Excel files
        and converts them into a clean, production-ready configuration for Telegraf agent.
        The program filters alarms and warnings, applies custom byte-order and formatting logic,
        and automatically generates Modbus input and holding register sections that can be appended
        directly to an existing <code>telegraf.conf</code>.
        Designed to streamline industrial data acquisition workflows and reduce manual configuration errors.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tech:</strong> Python, Pandas </p>

      <h3>TIG Stack with Local + Cloud Telegraf Pipelines</h3>
      <p><em>Private repository — available on request</em></p>
      <p>
        A fully containerized monitoring and data ingestion platform based on the TIG stack
        (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana), designed for environments with unreliable connectivity such as marine networks.
        The solution runs two Telegraf instances locally: one writes directly into a local InfluxDB for on-site monitoring,
        while the second forwards the same measurements to a separate cloud InfluxDB instance.
        Kafka is added as an intermediary between the local and cloud path to buffer telemetry and prevent data loss during
        intermittent connections or outages, enabling reliable store-and-forward behavior across unstable networks.
        The project includes automated provisioning of InfluxDB data sources, environment-driven Grafana dashboard templating,
        secure credential handling, and cross-platform deployment scripts.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tech:</strong> Docker, Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana, Kafka, Linux, Cloud - Digital Ocean, Bash/Shell scripts </p>

      <h3>Text-to-Speech PDF Processing Pipeline</h3>
      <p><em>Private repository — available on request</em></p>
      <p>
        A Python-based pipeline (Version 1) that converts digital PDF documents into high-quality speech audio.
        The project extracts and preprocesses text, safely chunks it for cloud text-to-speech limits, 
        and generates natural-sounding MP3 audiobooks using modern neural voices. 
        Designed as an initial production-ready version, with clear limitations documented and 
        a roadmap for future improvements including OCR support, advanced text processing, and configurable voice options.

      <h3>Cold War Space Race: Global Launch Analysis (1957–2020)</h3>
      <p><em>Private repository — available on request</em></p>
      <p>
        A data analysis project exploring the evolution of global spaceflight from the early Cold War 
        through the modern commercial space era. The project analyses orbital launch data to compare 
        launch activity, success rates, and dominance across countries and organisations over time. 
        It includes cumulative and year-on-year analyses, failure rate trends, and leadership shifts 
        between state-driven space programs and private aerospace companies.
        Visualisations were created to clearly communicate long-term trends and turning points 
        for both technical and non-technical audiences.
        This project is one of the professional portfolio projects completed as part of the Udemy course:
        100 Days of Code™: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.

      <h3>Police Killings in the United States: Data Analysis & Trends</h3>
      <p><em>Private repository — available on request</em></p>
      <p>
        A data analysis project examining police-related fatalities in the United States, with a focus on
        demographic, geographic, and temporal patterns. The project explores how police killings vary by
        race, gender, age, mental health indicators, weapon status, and location, and investigates
        relationships between police violence and socioeconomic factors such as poverty and educational
        attainment at the state and city level.
        The analysis includes time-series trends, geographic choropleth mapping, city-level comparisons,
        and distributional visualisations designed to clearly communicate complex patterns and disparities.
